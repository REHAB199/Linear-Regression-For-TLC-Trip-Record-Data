# Linear-Regression-For-TLC-Trip-Record-Data MVP

We divide the data into three sections: training, verification, and testing.
#### process:
- clean the data and remove outliers and nulls
- converting datetime from object type to datetime type, adding new columns for months, days and hours.
#### analysis:
The following data was extracted:
- Fare Distribution.
- Payment depending on the trip distance.
- payment depending on the number of passengers.
- the most requested hours for trips.

#### application of machine learning to data:
- Apply the model to the training data.
- Apply the model to the verification data.

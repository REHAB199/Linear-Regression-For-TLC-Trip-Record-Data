# Project Proposal
#### (TLC Trip Record Data Prediction)

## Description:
This project about Green trip dataset in New York City for 2 months at 2021.
To do EDA and predict Fare amount.
The dataset provided by nyc.gov website:   
[https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)     

## Data:
The dataset contains 2 csv files: 
* Green trip data for January 2021
* Green trip data for February 2021


## Goals:
* Perform EDA. 
* Answer the questions:
  - What time was the most number of passengers? 
  - How many times did the passengers use the credit card?
  - How many times did the passengers use the cash?
  - What is the most used trip type for passengers?
  - Predict the fare amount of green taxi trip in New York City.
  to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.

## Tools:
* Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting.
* Scikit-learn for modeling.
* Tableau for interactive visualizations.
* Sklearn for linear regression.
